# ai-text-completion-project
This repository contains an AI-Powered Text Completion CLI, a capstone project demonstrating interaction with the mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model via the Hugging Face API. The application allows you to engage in an interactive session and dynamically adjust AI parameters such as temperature and max_tokens using simple commands. To get started, clone the repository, install the dependencies from requirements.txt, and create a .env file containing your HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN. Run the application from your terminal using python text_completion_app_hf.py and begin entering prompts. A detailed evaluation of the model's performance, including its strengths and limitations, is available in the accompanying project_report.pdf.
